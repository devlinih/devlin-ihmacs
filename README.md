# Devlin Ihmacs

A text editor written in Python.

# Pronunciation

The name of this project is a pun on Emacs and my last name. "Ih" is
pronounced like the letter E. Ihmacs is pronounced like Emacs, but My
name is Devlin Ih. In order to distinguish this from other Emacs-like
editors, I threw my first name in front of it.
